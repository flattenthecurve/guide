## Public gatherings
**Do not attend non-essential public gatherings**

There is overwhelming historical evidence for cancellation as an effective public health measure. I've retweeted some good resources
[here](https://twitter.com/joshmich/status/1235906489921007616), you can use that thread alone to help convince decisionmakers to cancel events.
Here's the money shot:

Don't wait to cancel until things are demonstrably really bad; this leaves available only the most socially disruptive interventions (like closing schools). Measures as extreme as closing schools tend to [burden vulnerable populations the most. (E.g., because the poorest kids only
eat at school).](https://twitter.com/AWhitTwit/status/1236010269605687296) If you're in a position to help kids in these scenarios, try to [give money directly](https://twitter.com/ClintSmithIII/status/1237004025331167233); the case for this is well established. When elementary schools close, it also makes it harder for health workers, teachers, city officials, etc. to get to work and keep things on track. Kids may have [nowhere to go
when parents are at work](https://twitter.com/AWhitTwit/status/1236010269605687296). Aggressive social distancing measures are never too late, but they are most effective at flattening the curve if undertaken before 1-2% of the population is infected \[ I read this somewhere but lost the citation, please [DM](https://twitter.com/figgyjam) if you can help\]. It isn't just large events to avoid, [even small meetings can have
consequences](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-06/biogen-employees-test-positive-for-covid-19-after-boston-meeting?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_source=twitter&cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm_content=business).

 

I've put out the call for tooling that would help event planners model go/no-go decisions more appropriately. If you are a scientist interested in collaborating on this, let me know. In meantime, here is this:
