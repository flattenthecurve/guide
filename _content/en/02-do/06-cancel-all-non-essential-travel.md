## Travel
**Cancel all non-essential travel anywhere**

This illness can [start slow and accelerate suddenly](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191). If you are away from home when it does, you're away from the systems that could keep you fed and cared for even if you turn out not to have a bad case. Even if you remain healthy, you could end up being quarantined. It is atbest boring, at worst [terrible conditions](https://twitter.com/alankilbourne2/status/1236541651692204033),
not to mention potentially really expensive. You could risk getting infected even if you are careful. Travel history is increasingly irrelevant to risk, especially because we are flying a bit blind with the lack of testing, but the available data of confirmed infections is
available [here](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) from Johns Hopkins University. Strain genetics information is available [here](https://nextstrain.org/ncov?label=clade:B4&m=div).
