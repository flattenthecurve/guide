## Spread the word 
**and lobby your reps for vital research**

If it is any indication, the link tracking for this very guidance document (stats can be viewed at [bit.ly/corona-guidance+](https://bit.ly/corona-guidance+)) shows that the word is getting out on twitter, where scientists have a larger usership; however it is lagging on facebook and on direct shares where the general public need it most. Call a friend. Call your family. You will have the most influence on people you personally know. While there are certainly reasons not to panic, most people should be more concerned than they are. Raise the floor of awareness, not the ceiling; this will be much more effective in the long run.

"One aspect of that policymakers desperately need more information on is how readily children can transmit the virus. We know children experience
milder disease than adults but do they transmit to others?" [There's been some seemingly contradictory evidence on this front so far.](https://twitter.com/joshmich/status/1236286986161356801)

In the meantime, do your best to demonstrate, teach, and reinforce good hand hygiene for kids, but be realistic too. In the absence of a clear signal on the degree to which kids are vectors, keep your kids' fingernails (and yours) as short as is (safely) possible so that virus has fewer crannies in which to hide. I've stopped wearing rings for that same reason; I don't know that there's been a formal study on this ring idea.

Only if you are in a financial and operational position to do so, consider temporarily tutoring or home schooling, or even just keeping kids home from after-school activities or for part of the school day.Don't compromise your kids' education, but every little bit of distancing helps. Do what you can and don't sweat the rest. You should not feel personally responsible for everyone.
