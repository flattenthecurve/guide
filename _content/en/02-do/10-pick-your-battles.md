## Social interactions
**Pick your battles; reduce non-essential social interactions**

On a lighter note, go ahead and use the pandemic excuse to beg out of any in-person meeting / party / wedding you would attend only out of
some vague sense of duty. If you're not really certain to enjoy it yourself or to bring joy to someone you really love then just. skip. it.
Attend remotely if you can. Or show your face for a few mins and head back out. Send a gift instead.

If you are planning a wedding and wondering what to do, a mini-thread [here](https://twitter.com/figgyjam/status/1236997165626478593) with
some options.
