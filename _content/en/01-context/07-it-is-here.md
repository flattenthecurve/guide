# It is here

Assume that the virus is already in your city / town / workplace / church / etc. It [almost certainly is "here" and is simply not yet
detected](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1234879748083503105) due to the shortage of tests. Moreover there are [6 states that still don't
have a single lab ready to carry out the test](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/06/812833596/coronavirus-14-deaths-now-in-u-s-new-cases-in-maryland-colorado) even if they had one in their hands. Estimates from Italy are that in
the early outbreak, the number of actual infections was [four times the number of cases than it was possible to confirm at the
time](https://twitter.com/AdamJKucharski/status/1236004937529798659). Cryptic transmission in the community was [happening for weeks before it
was detected in Seattle](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1236096904678633472). Seattle and Stanford are doing an amazing job of getting up to speed with their own testing kits; [about 5-7% of tests in Seattle are positive](https://twitter.com/UWVirology/status/1236017803162873856) and
anyone (with a doctor's indication) can be tested.

(For the sake of public health, University of Washington are publishing these results). So far only UW and Stanford have been moving ahead with
their own (non-CDC) testing; both of these institutions have mandated that in-person classes be moved to distance learning alternatives. That
speaks for itself; more universities should follow suit. That said, [professors need the technology and support to make this switch](https://twitter.com/ryanaboyd/status/1236009378295103488).

Education communities that are resource-poor (without laptops or internet) would have the hardest time doing this switch. So let's start
with those universities (and disciplines) for whom this switch is not such a major hardship. There is no one-size-fits-all intervention, but
speed is key. Professors, please don't wait for your [university administration to make the decision campus wide](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/03/06/roundup-weeks-news-about-colleges-and-coronavirus?utm_content=buffera0fc5&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin&utm_campaign=IHEbuffer). Move to a distance-based option of your own accord. [Check out these tips for teaching online in a pinch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QR7IEgdisO6JtmELs07uUsSSu2Yox86GJY9wGV6mBjA/edit#).
