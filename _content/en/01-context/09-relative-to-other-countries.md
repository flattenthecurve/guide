# Policies
**Relative to other countries, US labor and healthcare policies are a perfect storm for pandemics**

-   Zero universal guaranteed [paid sick leave](https://www.worldpolicycenter.org/policies/for-how-long-are-workers-guaranteed-paid-sick-leave)
-   Even among those \*with\* paid sick leave, the covered time frame is often on the order of days, not the weeks adequate to account for
    prolonged illness.
-   Zero guaranteed paid family leave to care for sick members
-   Zero guaranteed financial or operational support for people who should self-quarantine. [People are therefore ignoring quarantine
    because they need to eat.](https://twitter.com/abcnews/status/1236462655012917249)
-   Many people are uninsured. Given where things are right now (cryptic transmission and no available vaccine), the insurance companies have
    a moral obligation but have no financial incentive to improve testing and ensure access to care.
-   In the USA insurance is tied to their employment, so when they get sick they are also vulnerable to bankruptcy. In a pandemic year this is devastating for an economy.

The fact that these safety nets have not previously existed in the US complicates the behaviors required to #flattenthecurve compared to most other countries affected so far. However, legislation passed Friday by the US House of Representatives aims to address some of these critical issues. Namely, the bill will provide enhanced unemployment benefits, free virus testing, and additional funds for food assistance and Medicaid. The bill is reported in the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-relief-congress.html), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/politics/coronavirus-relief-congress/index.html) and by other news organizations.

# Global tracking and communication

Doctors worldwide are getting pummeled on the frontlines of this crisis,
the lack of protective equipment is causing them to get infected, and themselves unable to get the care they need. For a personal lens on
this, have a look [here](https://twitter.com/stuff_so/status/1236467114933813248), but this is by no means unique; the accounts are flooding in.

Globally speaking, [authoritarianism can limit pandemic control](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/02/coronavirus-and-blindness-authoritarianism/606922/) since it can limit the expertise and transparency required for good decisionmaking, to make the best use of resources, and to communicate status to the regional and global citizens. Examples of this have been seen in China (earliest in the epidemic), and in Iran, Turkey and Russia, which until recently had reported the statistically unrealistic scenario of no cases. Country-specific US Embassy pages now are now reporting cases, for example [Russian Embassy](https://ru.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/). A number of effective data visualizations and world-wide case tracking are now available, for example at the [Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) and the [New York Times Coronavirus Case Maps](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html)
