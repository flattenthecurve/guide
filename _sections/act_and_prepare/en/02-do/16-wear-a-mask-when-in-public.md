### Wear a facemask when in public

Context: facemask here means any "face coverings", including scarves and bandanas.

If you absolutely have to venture into public where other people may be, buy a cloth mask or make
your own as even US hospital chains are beginning to do.

Studies in previous years as well as COVID-19 ones in the last couple of months have shown for
Influenza that a face covering may have a self-protection benefit.  The viron (complete virus
particle) that causes COVID-19 is roughly the same size as the Influenza viron at 125 nanometers and
it has the same mechanisms of entering the human body, and the older studies showed facemask
protected you to some degree from being infected with Influenza.

On April 3, the US Center for Disease Control (CDC), "recommends wearing cloth face coverings in
public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery
stores and pharmacies) **especially** in areas of significant community-based transmission". See the
[article on their site](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html)

On April 3, the World Health Organization's top emergencies expert, Mike Ryan, during their daily
news conference, said: "... The idea of using respiratory coverings or mouth coverings to prevent
coughing and sneezing projecting disease into the environment and towards others ... that in itself
is not a bad idea ..." (and more). There's no page reflecting this change of policy yet. See the

mask" initiative on March 21 - ([Video](https://vimeo.com/399324367/13cd93f150)).

By the third week of March, the countries of Vietnam, The Czech Republic (Czechia), and Slovakia are
now operating a "wear a mask when in public" policy for their citizens and that includes homemade
cloth masks. Austria is mandating that supermarket shoppers wear facemasks while shopping - see
