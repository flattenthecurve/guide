**Only go to hospital when you have trouble breathing or you are short of breath (sitting, going to bathroom, walking, etc).**

Gastrointestinal Symptoms (rare): 
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal discomfort are all possible early symptoms. They may appear a couple of days BEFORE the respiratory symptoms. 

Timeline  
-  Mild cases usually clear up in 7 days (no hospitalization). 
-  It can take 2-14 days for the first covid19 symptom to develop. 88% of them eventually have fever. 
For nearly half of the hospitalized patients, fever may not develop before you need to be admitted to hospital. 
-  By day 5, patients of preconditions may have trouble breathing (**go to hospital**). 

Recovery time: (for all patients that develop pneumonia) 
-  Mild: a few days.     
-  Severe: 2-1/2 weeks.  
-  Critical (with ARDS): 30-40% fatal. Recovery could take months.
