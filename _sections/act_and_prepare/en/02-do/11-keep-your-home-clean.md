[You can find CDC Recommendations

Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them with detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.


To make a bleach solution, mix 5 tablespoons (1/3 cup) bleach per gallon of water OR 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of
water.

If you have the ability to do so, consider a 'staging' area for clean entry into your home. Remove shoes, outerwear. If you work in a high risk environment like a hospital, nursing home, etc, wash your clothes immediately and then dry them at high heat or at least dry in the sunshine. Wash hands right away. Isolate your mail, packages and purchases (including food) before bringing them into the house and leave them isolated a few hours at a minimum. If you are in an especially high risk group, you might want to consider leaving goods isolated a longer time (a few days) and avoid eating raw produce, and also decontaminating products that come into your house.
The latest [research](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v1.full.pdf) shows that the virus can survive up to 4 hours on copper surfaces, up to 3 days on plastic and stainless steel, and up to 24 hours on cardboard.
