### Do not be racist

Racist assumptions lead to racist behaviors. Racist behaviors divide us, and in this pandemic situation, definitely work against us. If we divide ourselves according to race, ethnicity, or nationality, the virus wins and we all lose, plain and simple. If we unite ourselves regardless of race, ethnicity, or nationality, the virus loses and we all win.
