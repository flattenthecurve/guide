### Do not touch your face

[This is a way that the virus can enter the body.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html)
It is really hard to avoid; this is also why we advise staying home and avoiding crowds. It is also why top-down measures (event cancellation and imposed quarantine etc) work. The average person, even ones with baseline good hygiene, touch their faces constantly already without thinking about it. Especially with allergy season coming up, please keep this in mind.
